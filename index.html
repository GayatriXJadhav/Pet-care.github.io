                    animal welfare in India.
                    <br />
                    We believe that the power of compassion,love,generous & kind
                    nature will have a positive impact on the lives of animals
                    around the country.
                    <br />
                    We try to rescue, treat , rehabillate, feed and love the
                    needy animals.
                    <br />
                    The mission is to resuce the animals, to help them get new
                    homes and most importantly is to build a compassionate
                    society which will not show love only towards the animals in
                    the house but also towards the street animals.
