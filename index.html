                    impact on the lives of animals around the country. We try to

                    animals. <img src="./photos/cat1.jpg" alt="" />

                    The mission is to resuce the animals, to help them get new
                    homes and most importantly is to build a compassionate
                    society which will not show love only towards the animals in
                    the house but also towards the street animals.
